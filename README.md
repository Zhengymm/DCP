# DCP
Implementation for DCP-DEC model.
Paper: Deep Embedded Clustering with Distribution Consistency Preservation for Attributed Networks

# Data
Due to the limitation of file size, we give some examples of the real-word datasets and the generated artificial attributed networks.

# Code & Usage
Here we provide an implementation in PyTorch, along with an execution example on an artificial attributed network (with Î¼=0.6 & noise ratio is 20%)(due to file size limit). The repository is organised as follows:

runDCP.py: main process to train the model.
utils.py: processes the dataset before passing to the network.
model.py: defines the autoencoder and graph autoencoder.
evaluation.py: evaluation indicators to verify the performance of the model.
pretrain.py: pretrain the autoencoder and graph autoeencoder to get node representations for initializing.

Note that for different datasets, we should change configures of the model to get the best performance.

Example:
python runDCP.py --name lfr100060 --alpha 0.1 --beta 0.01 --gamma 0.5
